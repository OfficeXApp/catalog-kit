# Catalog Funnel

Build and manage marketing catalogs, landing pages, and multi-step funnels — directly through your AI agent. Create catalogs with 56+ component types, publish them to your custom subdomain, run A/B split tests, and monitor conversion analytics in real time.

> **Install on OfficeX:** [officex.app/store/en/app/catalog-funnel](https://officex.app/store/en/app/catalog-funnel)

## What You Can Do

- **Create catalogs** — build lead capture forms, product catalogs, multi-step funnels from a JSON schema
- **Publish instantly** — catalogs go live at `https://yourname.catalogs.cloud.zoomgtm.com/your-slug`
- **Check analytics** — see visitors, conversions, page drop-off, field completions, referrer sources, and revenue
- **Run A/B tests** — split traffic between catalog variants to find what converts best
- **AI variant routing** — auto-route visitors to the best catalog variant using natural language hints
- **Sandbox editing** — clone a catalog to safely make changes without affecting the live version, then promote when ready
- **Element inspector** — hold Shift+Alt to hover-inspect any element and copy its exact `pageId/componentId` reference for AI agents
- **View visitor journeys** — trace exactly what each visitor did step by step
- **Manage access** — create API keys for team members or integrations
- **Upload videos** — add video content with automatic HLS transcoding

## Getting Started

After installing Catalog Funnel on OfficeX, you receive credentials automatically. You can also sign up at the dashboard and create API keys from Settings.

```bash
# Your API key (created from Settings page or received on install)
CF_API_KEY="cfk_..."

# Production API
CF_API_URL="https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com"
```

### Authentication

Pass your API key as a Bearer token on all requests:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer cfk_..." \
  https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs
```

If you installed via OfficeX, you can also use your install credentials:

```bash
TOKEN=$(echo -n "${OFFICEX_INSTALL_ID}:${OFFICEX_INSTALL_SECRET}" | base64)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs
```

## Managing Catalogs

### List your catalogs

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "catalog_id": "01HXY...",
      "slug": "my-funnel",
      "name": "My Funnel",
      "status": "published",
      "visibility": "public",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create a catalog

```
POST https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs
```

```json
{
  "slug": "spring-sale",
  "name": "Spring Sale Landing Page",
  "schema": { ... },
  "status": "published",
  "visibility": "public"
}
```

- `slug` — URL-friendly name (lowercase, hyphens). Your catalog will be live at `https://yourname.catalogs.cloud.zoomgtm.com/spring-sale`
- `status` — `"published"` (live) or `"draft"` (hidden). Default: `"published"`
- `visibility` — `"public"` (listed) or `"unlisted"` (link-only). Default: `"unlisted"`

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "catalog_id": "01HXY...",
    "slug": "spring-sale",
    "name": "Spring Sale Landing Page",
    "status": "published",
    "visibility": "public",
    "url": "https://yourname.catalogs.cloud.zoomgtm.com/spring-sale"
  }
}
```

### View a catalog

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs/:id
```

Returns the full catalog including its schema.

### Update a catalog

```
PUT https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs/:id
```

All fields are optional — only send what you want to change:

```json
{
  "name": "Updated Name",
  "schema": { ... },
  "status": "draft",
  "visibility": "public",
  "slug": "new-slug",
  "old_slug_action": "redirect"
}
```

When changing the slug, `old_slug_action` controls what happens to the old URL:
- `"redirect"` (default) — old URL redirects to the new one
- `"release"` — old URL becomes available for reuse

### Delete a catalog

```
DELETE https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs/:id
```

## Analytics & Results

All analytics endpoints require authentication. Each analytics call costs **1 credit**. Event tracking (visitor activity) is **free**.

### Overview metrics

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/analytics/catalogs/:id
```

**Query params:** `start`, `end` (ISO dates, e.g. `2024-01-01`)

Returns aggregate metrics: unique visitors, total page views, form submissions, conversion rate, page-level views, variant breakdown, referrer sources, checkout stats, and revenue.

### Timeseries (daily/hourly trends)

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/analytics/catalogs/:id/timeseries
```

**Query params (required):** `start`, `end` (ISO dates), `interval` (`day` or `hour`)

```json

  "ok": true,
  "data": [
    { "date": "2024-01-01", "page_views": 150, "sessions": 80, "form_submits": 25, "checkout_completes": 5, "revenue_cents": 4900 }
  ]
}
```

### Drop-off analysis

See exactly where visitors abandon your funnel:

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/analytics/catalogs/:id/dropoff
```

**Query params:** `start`, `end` (ISO dates)

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "total_visitors": 500,
    "pages": [
      { "page_id": "intro", "visitors": 500, "drop_off_rate": 0 },
      { "page_id": "questions", "visitors": 350, "drop_off_rate": 30 }
    ],
    "fields": [
      { "field_id": "questions/email", "completions": 300, "completion_rate": 85.7 }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Response distributions

See how visitors answered each question or form field:

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/analytics/catalogs/:id/responses
```

**Query params:** `start`, `end`, `page_id`, `component_id` (all optional)

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "components": {
      "questions/q1": {
        "total_responses": 200,
        "distribution": {
          "Option A": { "count": 112, "percent": 56 },
          "Option B": { "count": 28, "percent": 14 },
          "Option C": { "count": 60, "percent": 30 }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Raw events

Browse individual visitor events with filtering:

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/analytics/catalogs/:id/events
```

**Query params:** `start`, `end`, `cursor`, `limit` (default 100, max 5000), `event_type`, `page_id`, `component_id`, `variant_slug`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `referrer`

Response includes a `cursor` for pagination (null when done).

### Visitor journey

Trace a single visitor's complete journey through your catalog:

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/analytics/tracers/:tracerId
```

Returns every event in chronological order with a summary: total events, first/last seen, pages viewed, and whether they submitted.

---

## A/B Split Tests

Test different versions of your catalog to find what converts best. Split tests route visitors to different catalog variants based on weighted traffic distribution.

### Create a split test

```
POST https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/split-tests
```

```json
{
  "slug": "spring-sale",
  "name": "Spring Sale A/B Test",
  "destinations": [
    { "slug": "spring-sale-v1", "weight": 50, "label": "Control" },
    { "slug": "spring-sale-v2", "weight": 50, "label": "New headline" }
  ]
}
```

The `slug` is the URL visitors see. They get routed to one of the destination catalogs based on weights. Visitors are sticky — they always see the same variant on return visits.

### Other split test operations

- `GET /api/v1/split-tests` — List all split tests
- `GET /api/v1/split-tests/:slug` — Get one split test
- `PUT /api/v1/split-tests/:slug` — Update (change `name`, `destinations`, or `status`: `"active"` / `"paused"`)
- `DELETE /api/v1/split-tests/:slug` — Delete a split test

---

## Schema Introspection

Get a map of all pages and components in a catalog — useful for understanding the structure before querying analytics:

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs/:id/schema/ids
```

```json
{
  "pages": {
    "landing": { "title": "Get Started", "index": 0 },
    "details": { "title": "Your Details", "index": 1 }
  },
  "components": {
    "landing/email": { "type": "email", "label": "Your Email", "required": true },
    "landing/company": { "type": "short_text", "label": "Company Name" }
  },
  "routing_entry": "landing"
}
```

---

## API Keys

Manage API keys for team members or integrations.

- `POST /api/v1/api-keys` — Create a key (roles: `reader`, `editor`, `admin`, `custom`). Returns the secret once — store it securely.
- `GET /api/v1/api-keys` — List all keys (secrets redacted)
- `DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/:keyId` — Revoke a key
- `POST /api/v1/api-keys/:keyId/rotate` — Rotate: revokes old key, creates new one with same config

---

## Videos

Upload video content to use in your catalogs with automatic HLS transcoding:

- `POST /api/v1/videos/upload` — Upload a video file
- `GET /api/v1/videos/:videoId/status` — Check transcoding progress
- `GET /api/v1/videos/:videoId/hls_url` — Get the playback URL

---

## Webhooks

If your catalog has a `webhook_url` configured in its schema, all visitor events are forwarded there in real time. Each webhook payload includes an `event_id` (ULID) for deduplication and `schema_ref` with human-readable page/component context.

---

## Variant Analytics

Every catalog gets an automatic `catalog:{catalog_id}` tag. To compare analytics across catalog variants (e.g. for A/B tests), add the base catalog's `catalog:{base_id}` tag to each variant's `schema.tags`. API keys scoped with matching `tag_patterns` can then query analytics across all tagged variants.

---

## Catalog Schema Reference

A catalog schema defines your entire funnel as JSON. Here's a minimal lead capture example:

```json
{
  "slug": "lead-capture",
  "pages": [
    {
      "id": "landing",
      "title": "Get Started",
      "components": [
        { "id": "name", "type": "short_text", "label": "Your Name", "required": true },
        { "id": "email", "type": "email", "label": "Email", "required": true }
      ],
      "submit_label": "Submit"
    }
  ],
  "routing": { "entry": "landing", "edges": [] }
}
```

### Component Types (56 total)

**Input (27):** `short_text`, `long_text`, `rich_text`, `email`, `phone`, `url`, `password`, `number`, `currency`, `date`, `datetime`, `time`, `date_range`, `dropdown`, `multiselect`, `multiple_choice`, `checkboxes`, `picture_choice`, `star_rating`, `slider`, `file_upload`, `signature`, `address`, `location`, `switch`, `checkbox`, `choice_matrix`, `ranking`, `opinion_scale`

**Display (11):** `heading`, `paragraph`, `banner`, `image`, `video`, `pdf_viewer`, `social_links`, `html`, `divider`, `faq`, `testimonial`, `pricing_card`

**Layout (3):** `section_collapse`, `table`, `subform`

**Page features:** `payment`, `captcha`

### Multi-Page Routing

Route visitors through different pages based on their answers:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "entry": "landing",
    "edges": [
      {
        "from": "landing",
        "to": "enterprise",
        "conditions": {
          "match": "all",
          "rules": [{ "field": "company_size", "operator": "greater_than", "value": 100 }]
        }
      },
      { "from": "landing", "to": "standard", "is_default": true }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Condition operators:** `equals`, `not_equals`, `contains`, `not_contains`, `greater_than`, `less_than`, `greater_than_or_equal`, `less_than_or_equal`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `regex`, `in`, `not_in`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`, `between`

### Quiz Scoring

Add quiz scoring to any multiple choice or input component:

```json
{
  "id": "q1",
  "type": "multiple_choice",
  "label": "What does CTA stand for?",
  "options": ["Click To Act", "Call To Action", "Create The Ad"],
  "quiz": { "correct_answer": "Call To Action", "points": 10, "explanation": "CTA = Call To Action" }
}
```

Score-based routing: `{ "score": "percent", "operator": "greater_than", "value": 80 }`

### Popups

Trigger popups based on visitor behavior:

```json
{
  "popups": [
    {
      "id": "exit-popup",
      "trigger": { "type": "exit_intent", "delay_ms": 3000 },
      "pages": ["landing"],
      "mode": "modal",
      "content": { "title": "Wait!", "body": "Get 10% off before you go" }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Trigger types:** `exit_intent`, `scroll_depth`, `inactive`, `timed`, `page_count`, `custom`, `video_progress`, `video_chapter`

### Completion Screen

Customize what visitors see after submitting:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "completion": {
      "heading": "You're all set!",
      "message": "We'll be in touch within 24 hours.",
      "redirect_url": "https://example.com",
      "redirect_delay": 3000,
      "actions": [
        { "type": "fill_again", "label": "Submit Again", "style": "secondary" },
        { "type": "share", "label": "Share", "style": "ghost" },
        { "type": "redirect", "label": "Visit Site", "url": "https://example.com", "style": "primary" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Action types:** `fill_again` (reset form), `share` (copy URL), `redirect` (navigate to URL). All fields are optional — omit `completion` entirely for a minimal checkmark screen.

---

## CLI

Manage catalogs from the command line:

```bash
npx catalogs catalog push schema.json --publish    # Create or update a catalog from a JSON file
npx catalogs catalog list                           # List all your catalogs
npx catalogs video upload ./intro.mp4               # Upload a video
npx catalogs video status VIDEO_ID                  # Check transcoding progress
```

---

## AI Variant Routing

Automatically route visitors to the best catalog variant using natural language hints. Instead of requiring exact variant slugs, pass a description and let the AI pick the right variant.

### Route a visitor with a hint (GET — query param)

```
# Using subdomain:
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/public/route-variant?subdomain=yourname&slug=my-catalog&hint="female entrepreneur interested in social media"

# Using custom domain instead:
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/public/route-variant?domain=funnels.mycompany.com&slug=my-catalog&hint="female entrepreneur interested in social media"
```

> **Note:** Use quotes around the hint value for readability — browsers automatically encode `"` to `%22` and spaces to `+`/`%20`. Both `hint`/`hints` and `subdomain`/`domain` are accepted.

### Route a visitor with a hint (POST — JSON body)

If URL encoding is a concern, use the POST alternative with a JSON body:

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/public/route-variant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subdomain": "yourname",
    "slug": "my-catalog",
    "hint": "female entrepreneur interested in social media"
  }'
```

Both `hint`/`hints` and `subdomain`/`domain` are accepted.

**Response (same for GET and POST):**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "variant_slug": "problem-aware-female",
    "reason": "ai_matched"
  }
}
```

`reason` values: `ai_matched` (LLM picked best match), `single_variant` (only one variant exists), `no_variants` (catalog has no variants), `fallback` (LLM couldn't decide, returned first variant).

### Frontend hint URLs

The frontend handles AI routing automatically — just add `hint` to the URL. Works on both subdomain URLs and custom domains:

```
# Subdomain URL:
https://yourname.catalogs.cloud.zoomgtm.com/my-catalog?hint="female entrepreneur"&ref=253

# Custom domain URL (works the same way):
https://funnels.mycompany.com/my-catalog?hint="female entrepreneur"&ref=253

# Silent redirect (for affiliates — suppresses event tracking):
https://yourname.catalogs.cloud.zoomgtm.com/my-catalog?hint="problem aware male"&silent_redirect=true&ref=253

# After AI routing resolves, browser URL updates to:
https://yourname.catalogs.cloud.zoomgtm.com/my-catalog/problem-aware-male?ref=253
```

The base catalog renders instantly while AI routing resolves in the background. Visitors never see a loading screen — the variant swap is seamless.

---

## Sandbox Mode

Edit catalogs safely without affecting production. A sandbox is a full clone of your catalog with its own URL and schema — make changes, preview live, and promote when ready.

### Create a sandbox

```
POST https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs/:id/sandbox
```

```json
{
  "suffix": "redesign-v2"
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "catalog_id": "01ABC...",
    "slug": "spring-sale--redesign-v2",
    "name": "Spring Sale Landing Page (Sandbox: redesign-v2)",
    "sandbox_of": "01HXY...",
    "parent_slug": "spring-sale",
    "url": "https://yourname.catalogs.cloud.zoomgtm.com/spring-sale--redesign-v2"
  }
}
```

The sandbox is a regular catalog with its own URL. Edit it freely using `PUT /api/v1/catalogs/:sandbox_id` — your production catalog is untouched. The frontend shows an amber "SANDBOX" banner so you always know you're in sandbox mode.

### List sandboxes for a catalog

```
GET https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs/:id/sandboxes
```

### Promote sandbox to production

Copy the sandbox schema to the parent catalog:

```
POST https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs/:sandbox_id/promote
```

```json
{
  "delete_sandbox": true
}
```

By default the sandbox is deleted after promotion. Set `"delete_sandbox": false` to keep it.

### Discard a sandbox

```
DELETE https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/api/v1/catalogs/:sandbox_id
```

### Listing catalogs with sandboxes

By default, `GET /api/v1/catalogs` hides sandboxes. Add `?include_sandboxes=true` to include them. Each catalog response includes `sandbox_of` (null for regular catalogs, parent catalog ID for sandboxes).

---

## Element Inspector (DevEx)

Built-in developer tool for AI agent workflows. Hold **Shift+Alt** and hover over any element in a live catalog to see its exact reference path (`pageId/componentId`) with a one-click copy button.

This makes it trivial to tell an AI agent exactly which element to modify — no guessing, no digging through JSON.

The reference format matches the schema introspection endpoint (`GET /api/v1/catalogs/:id/schema/ids`), so copied references map 1:1 to API paths.

**How to use:**

1. Open any catalog in the browser
2. Hold **Shift+Alt** — a "Inspector active" indicator appears
3. Hover over any element — it highlights with an indigo border and shows a tooltip with `pageId/componentId (type)`
4. Click **Copy** to copy the reference to clipboard
5. Paste the reference into your AI agent conversation (e.g. "change the heading at `landing/hero-title`")

---

## Event Tracking (Free)

Visitor events are tracked automatically by the catalog frontend. You can also send custom events:

```
POST https://catalog-funnel-api.cloud.zoomgtm.com/events
```

**Valid event types:** `page_view`, `field_change`, `field_complete`, `form_submit`, `action_click`, `exit_intent`, `session_start`, `session_resume`, `cart_add`, `cart_remove`, `checkout_start`, `checkout_skip`, `checkout_complete`, `payment_info_added`, `offer_declined`, `lead_captured`, `video_play`, `video_pause`, `video_progress`, `video_complete`, `video_chapter`, `video_seek`

Batch up to 25 events: `POST /events/batch` with `{ "events": [...] }`
